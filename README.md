# Project-Leading-Causes-Of-Death

Background: Scientists are constantly trying to find out what factors leads to death whether it be behavioral, environmental, or financial.

Goal: Analyze the relationship between tobacco use, obesity, and income on the number of deaths per state and on a national level

Hypothesis: Obesity, Tobacco, and income are all positively correlated factors to number of deaths

Variables for Exploration: Tobacco Use %, Obesity %, Per Capita Income, Number of Deaths 

What Didn’t Work:  Scope of our project was too big at first, Too many variables, Too broad, Constantly had to adjust timeline 
Dropdown/Filter & incorporating javascript, Visualization Issues

What Worked: Flask (after many days and figuring out), D3 (after many attempts), the Index 

Trends Found: 
None of the variables explored contribute alone to the number of deaths

Most of the states per capita income for all years shows that although, income increases slightly. deaths are only slightly increasing 

Relative to each state, obesity rates don’t change significantly per year

Number of deaths nationally increase every year

With More time: We considered adding dropdowns that enable the user to select and filter out the graphs as well as another js library.
